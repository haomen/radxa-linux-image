### Radxa Linux Images

1. Radxa EMMC version supports image on both EMMC and TF card, when image exist on both storage locations, system boot from **TF card image**;
2. Kali linux does not provide a prebuild linux image for download, following [arm-build-scripts](https://www.kali.org/docs/development/arm-build-scripts/), I built arm64 image and available [here](http://menhao.net/download/kali-arm-radxz-zero-sdcard-image-2023-07-02/)
